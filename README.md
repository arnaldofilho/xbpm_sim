This project is part of a set of tools to simulate and model blade and diode-array XBPMs. It was conceived at Sirius-LNLS-CNPEM, the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory, by the Insertion and Diagnostics Devices Group (IDS).

X-ray Beam Position Monitors (XBPMs) are devices used to measure the position of an X-ray beam within a synchrotron beamline. Due to their inherent design —specifically their geometry and electronic characteristics — the beam's position is not measured directly. Instead, it is calculated by linearizing data obtained from the monitor's central region. This simulation investigates the potential effects of various factors on XBPM performance, including different geometries, construction imperfections, asymmetric electronic gains, and variations in the radiation profile (such as Gaussian beams with different variances, or profiles simulated from sources like benders or undulators).
